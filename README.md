# header_scan
The program will read the email from the specified file and check the headers for any suspicious information. If it finds any suspicious information, it will output a message saying that the email may be a phishing email. Otherwise, it will output a message saying that the email is not a phishing email.

To use the program, you can run it from the command line like this:

python email_checker.py <email_file>

*Note that this is just an example of how you can check the headers of an email to detect phishing emails. It is not a complete solution, as there are many other ways that phishing emails can be disguised. To effectively detect phishing emails, you will need to use a more comprehensive approach that takes into account a wider range of indicators.

Here are some additional considerations you can take into account to improve the effectiveness of detecting phishing emails:

    Check the links in the email: Phishing emails often contain links to malicious websites. You can check the links in the email to see if they lead to suspicious or untrusted websites.

    Check the spelling and grammar: Phishing emails often contain spelling and grammar mistakes, which can be a clue that the email is not legitimate.

    Check for unexpected attachments: Phishing emails may contain attachments that are infected with malware or that contain malicious links. Be wary of opening any attachments from unknown or untrusted sources.

    Look for a sense of urgency: Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency to trick the recipient into taking immediate action. Be cautious of emails that ask you to take urgent action, such as clicking on a link or entering sensitive information.

    Verify the sender's identity: Make sure that the sender of the email is who they claim to be. Look for inconsistencies in the sender's email address or name, or check with the sender directly to confirm their identity.

    Use anti-phishing tools: There are various tools and services available that can help you detect and block phishing emails. These can include browser extensions, email filters, and anti-phishing software.
